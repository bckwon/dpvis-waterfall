DPVis-Waterfall is a Flask application for presenting disease progression pathways. It visualizes sequences of hidden states, learned by Hidden Markov Models, over time on longitudinal observational data. 
<br>
We used the source code to visualize figures in the paper published by Nature Communications:

> [**Progression of type 1 diabetes from latency to symptomatic disease is predicted by distinct autoimmune trajectories**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28909-1),

The full-fledge visualization system was introduced in the following paper published by IEEE TVCG.

## Requirements

Python 3.7.4

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install packages. 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run Flask Server on the Project Root Directory.

```bash
python app.py
```

While the server is running, launch a modern web browser (e.g., Firefox) and go to [https://localhost:4848](https://localhost:4848). It may take 1-3 minutes to completely load the page depending on the computing environment. 

For demonstration, we use a synthetic dataset: `/static/data/dpvis-csv-file.csv`
